# Taxonomy
#biology #NCERT #MOC 

Process of classifying [[Living Things]] into **taxa** (categories, sg.:taxon)
naming each thing is [[Nomenclature]]

### Common Categories
Taxonomical Studies have led to development of common ranks of categories (decending order):
1. [[Kingdom]] ([[Five Kingdom Classification]])
2. [[Phylum]] or [[Division]] (for plants)
	3. [[Chordata]] - Invertebrates
3. [[Class]]
	1. [[Mammalia]]
4. [[Order]]
	1. [[Polymoniales]]
	2. [[Carnivora]]
	3. [[Primata]]
5. [[Family]]
	1. [[Solanaceae]]
	2. [[Felidae]]
	3. [[Canidae]]
6. [[Genus]]
	1. [[Solanum]]
	2. [[Panthera]]
	3. [[Felis]]
7. [[Species]]
	1. ![[Nomenclature#^61fa2b]]

there are more sub categories but oh well 

All organisms have [[Species]] as lowest category
should be able to distinguish different species by morphological charecteristics

### AAA I hope i don't forget this table
