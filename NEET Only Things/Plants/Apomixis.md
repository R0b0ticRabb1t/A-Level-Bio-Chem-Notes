# Apomixis
#biology/plants #NCERT/12 

[[Asexual Reprouction]], but mimics [[Sexual Reproduction In Flowering Plants]].
[[Seed]] is formed without fertilization.
A few methods:
- diploid egg cell, no reduction division
- Nucellar Cells ([[Megasporangium#^6e8699|nucellus]]) divide and protrude into [[Embryo Sac]]
	- *[[Citrus]]* & *[[Mango]]*
	- each ovule contains many embryos - [[Polyembryony]]

Apomixis basically makes clone seeds, super helpful especially for hybrid plants. 

eg. *[[Asteraceae]]* and grasses
