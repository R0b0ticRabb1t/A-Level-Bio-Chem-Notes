# Anther
#biology/plants #NCERT/12 

In typical [[Angiosperms]]: 
- anther is **bilobed**.
	- lobes are seperated by the **Line of dehiscence
- Each lobe has two **[[theca]]** (**dithecous**)

The anther has a *tetragonal*(four sided) shape, With two **[[Microsporangium]]** in each lobe

Microsporangium develop into [[Pollen]] sacs, extending from top to bottom of the anther

#### When the anther is young
Microsporangium center occupied by **[[sporogenous tissues]]** containing [[Microsporocytes]] that undergo [[Microsporogenesis]] forming [[Microspores]]

#### As anther matures
It gets dehydrated and microspores dissociate & develop into [[Pollen]] grains.

Millions of [[Pollen]] grains are released with the [[dehiscence]] of the anther. ^330b1b
