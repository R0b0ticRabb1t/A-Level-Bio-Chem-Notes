# Embryo Sac (Ovule In Plants)
#biology/plants #NCERT/12 

Represents the [[Megagametophyte]]

### Formation
The one functional megaspore (haploid?) divides by [[Mitosis]],
1 nucleate --> 2 -> 4 -> 8 nucleate (still no cell walls)

Then cell walls form and seperate the nuclei

![[Formation of the embryo sac.png]]

The [[Synergids]] have specialized cell thickening:[[Filiform Apparatus]]
\+ the egg cell = Egg apparatus
(important to remember micropylar and chalazal end)

Polar nuclei lie in central cell,

### After [[Double Fertilization]] 
- central cell-> endosperm
- egg cell-> [[zygote]] -> embryo
[[Embryo Development (Plants)]] will occur here
