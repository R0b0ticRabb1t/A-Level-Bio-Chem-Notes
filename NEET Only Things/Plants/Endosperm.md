# Endosperm 
#biology/plants  #NCERT/12 

the primary endosperm cell is formed from [[Triple Fusion]]. 
Endosperm development happens first before embryo development. Filled with reserve food and nutrients.

In many plants, the triploid nuclei divide first forming **free-nuclear endosperm** and cell wall formation happens after.
