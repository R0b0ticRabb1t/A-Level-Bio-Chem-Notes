# Seeds
#biology #NCERT/12 

Seeds are the fertilized [[Megasporangium|Ovule]]. formed inside [[Fruits]] (fertilized [[Ovary (Plants)|Ovary]]).

#### Types of seeds (By [[Endosperm]] persistence):
1. **Non-albuminous:** Endosperm is completely consumed during development
	1. [[Pea]]
	2. groundnut
2. **Ex-albuminous**: Little endosperm remaining in seed
3. **Albuminous**: Significant endosperm remaining
	1. [[wheat]]
	2. [[Maize]]
	3. barley
	4. [[castor]]

### Changing Structures
Some seeds have a residue persistent [[Megasporangium#^6e8699|Nucellus]]--> [[Perisperm]]. 
- eg: **black pepper** and **beet**
Integuments harden --> seed coat
Micropyle stays as a hole for water and oxygen for seed to [[Germinate]]
Seed matures, water content decreases (10-15% moisture/mass left)

embryo could become dormant, or [[Germinate]]

### Advantages:
- formation is less dependent on water
- easier to spread seeds
- food reserves supply until seed is ready to photosynthesize 
- hard coat protec
- variation
