> [!info] Meristems are regions with active [[Cell division]].

   1. **Apical Meristematic Tissues**
	   1. Tip of root and shoot
	   2. Most distant points on vertical axis
   2. **Intercalary Meristematic Tissues**
		1. Found at the base of [[plant nodes]] and [[plant internodes]]
2. Secondary: Horizontal growth, happen later
