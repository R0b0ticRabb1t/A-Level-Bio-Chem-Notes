> [!info] Meristems are regions with active [[Cell division]].

Classified by location in plant
### Types of Meristematic Tissues
1. Primary: **Vertical** growth, and come first 
   1. **Apical Meristematic Tissues**
	   1. Tip of root and shoot
	   2. Most distant points on vertical axis
   2. **Intercalary Meristematic Tissues**
		1. Found at the base of [[plant nodes]] and [[plant internodes]]
2. Secondary: Horizontal growth, happen later
	1. **Lateral Meristematic Tissues**
		1. Increases thickness of plant
