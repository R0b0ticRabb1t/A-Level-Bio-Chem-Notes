## Xylem Vessels
#biology/plants 

### Functions of Xylem
- Conduct water and minerals upwards from the roots to the rest of the plant.
- Provide mechanical support
### Structure of Xylem Vessels
Made up of three [[Plant Tissues]]:
- **Tracheids**
	- Long cells
	- Lignified
	- Main conducting tissue
	- Tapering ends
- Vessels
	- Lignified walls
	- Large central cavity
- Xylem Fibres/[[Schlerenchyma]]
- Xylem [[Parenchyma]]
  >[!note] Parenchyma is the only living tissue here
> All the other cells are dead and without a [[Cytoplasm]]. Xylem is called a dead tissue
