# Pollen-Pistil Interaction
#biology #NCERT/12 

After the [[Pollen]] lands on [[Stigma]] by [[Pollination]],

Concepts are used in [[Artificial Hybridisation]] 

### Compatibility check
Stigma first checks compatability of the pollen by the chemicals it releases.
the pollen may be rejected if:
- its from a different species
- the plant is self incompatible ([[Outbreeding Devices]])
if rejected the pistil will prevent the pollen from germinating or the growth of pollen tube

### Germination
A pollen tube is produced at one of the germ pores of the [[Pollen]], which extends through the style and enters the [[Embryo Sac]] sac at the **Synergids** guided by the [[Filiform Apparatus]] at the **Micryopyar** end
Generative cell divides here if it hasn't already, vegetative cell degenerates after reaching

After this the 2 gametes enter the emrbyo sac and [[Double Fertilization]] occurs
