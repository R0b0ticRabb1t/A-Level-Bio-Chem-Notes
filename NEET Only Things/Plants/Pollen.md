# Pollen
#biology/plants #NCERT/12 

Represents male [[gametophyte]] in [[Angiosperms]]. 
### Structure
usually spherical, variety of features.
#### Two layered wall (outer and inner):
1. **Exine** 
	- [[Sporopollenin]] 
	- hard
	- has **germ pores** and intricate patterns  
2. **Intine** 
	- [[Cellulose]] & [[Pectin]] 
	- thin
	- continous

#### Mature pollen grains have 2 cells (60% released at this stage):
1. **Vegetative Cell**
	- Large
	- **Uneven nucleus**
	- Lots of food reserve
2. **Generative Cell**
	- Small
	- Spindle Shape
	- Dense nucleus and cytoplasm

In other 40%, generative cell divides into **two male gametes** before being shed (3 cell stage)

### Extra
Pollen grains cause allergies/chronic respiratory disorders
- [[asthma]]
- [[bronchitis]]

[[parthenium]]/ carrot grass, imported to india by contaminating wheat, causes pollen allergies

Rich in nutrients, claimed to help athletes and horses

**Viability** period varies a lot, depending on species and conditions,
- Rice & Wheat - unviable after 30 mins
- *[[Rosaceae]]*, *[[Leguminoseae]]* and *[[Solanaceae]]* - may be viable for months

Can be stored in **pollen banks** in liquid [[nitrogen]] for years
