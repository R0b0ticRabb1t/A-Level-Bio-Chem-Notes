Adaptations that prevent [[Inbreeding Depression]]/ encourage cross pollination

Different plants will have different ones or combinations
1. Pollen release and stigma receptivity is **unsynchronised**
	1. pollen released before or after stigma can recieve
2. Stigma & anther **positioned** so self pollination is unlikely
3. **Self Incompatibility**, genetic mechanism prevents self pollen fertilization by inhibiting
	1. pollen germination
	2. pollen tube growth
4. [[Dioecious flowers]]- eg. Papaya
