## Water Pollination - Hydrophily
#biology/plants #NCERT/12 


Rare, only ~30 [[Genera]], mostly [[Monocotyledons]] 
More common in lower plants, like [[Algae]], [[Bryophytes]], [[Pteridophytes]]
Distribution is therefore limited by water needed for pollination

Usually pollen grains have [[Mucilaginous]] covering to waterproof

Types:
- [[Epihydrophilly]] - surface, more common 
- [[Hypohydrophilly]] - true water pollination

For most aquatic plants, like **Water Hyacinth** and **Water Lily**, flowers rise to the top & pollination is [[Anemophily]] or [[Entomophily]]
