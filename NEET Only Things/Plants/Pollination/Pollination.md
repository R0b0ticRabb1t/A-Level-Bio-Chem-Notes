# Pollination
#biology/plants #NCERT/12 #MOC 

The transfer of [[Pollen]] grains from [[Anther]] to the [[Stigma]] of a [[Pistil]]

### Types of Pollination
- [[Autogamy]] 
	- ![[Autogamy]]
- [[Geitonogamy]] 
	- ![[Geitonogamy]]
- [[Xenogamy]] 
	- ![[Xenogamy]]
Xenogamy is preffered for genetic variation, as continued inbreeding leads to [[Inbreeding Depression]], prevented by [[Outbreeding Devices]]

### Pollinating Agents
#### Abiotic
usually not colorful or fragrant
- Air - [[Anemophily]]
- Water - [[Hydrophily]]
#### Biotic (more common)
usually colorful and fragrant to attract
many plants adapted to specific species pollinator
Rewards keep pollinators coming:
- Nectar
- Pollen grains (nutritious)
- Safe space to lay eggs 
	- *[[Amorphophallus]]*
	- A species of moth & *[[Yucca]]*
	- 
Bees dominate 
- Animals - Zoophily
	- Insects - [[Entomophily]]
	- Birds - [[Ornithophily]]
	- Snakes
