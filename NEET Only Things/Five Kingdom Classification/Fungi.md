# [[Kingdom]] Fungi
#biology #NCERT/11 

Morphology of **mycelium** and type of **reproduction** is the basis for classifying this kingdom

1. [[Phycomycetes]]
2. [[Ascomycetes]]
3. [[Basidiomycetes]]
4. [[Deuteromycetes]]

#### [[Reproduction in Fungi]] is a big part
### Structure
Fungi are usually filamentous (except [[Yeast]]). Consists of threadlike **Hyphae**.
Hyphae Network-> **Mycelium**
- some have **Coenocytic** hyphae
	- Multinucleated & continuous cytoplasm
- others have **septae**/cross walls
![[Cell Walls#^db0a99]]
### Nutrition![[Fungi.png|right|250]]
mostly [[Heterotrophic]]
often [[Saprophytes]]
some [[Parasites]], and also 
[[Symbionts]] (with algae = **lichens**, root of higher plants = **mycorrhiza**)
### Extra
- Diverse morphology and habitat 
	- prefers warm, humid and moist
	- can grow on rotten fruits/moldy bread
	- white spots on mustard leaves- parasitic fungus
- Examples
	- [[Yeast]] - Unicellular(exception)
	  makes bread and beer
	- *[[Puccinia]]* - causes wheat rust?
	- *[[Peniccillium]]* - source of antibiotic
