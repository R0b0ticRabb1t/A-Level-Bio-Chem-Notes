all [[Heterotrophic]], some [[Saprophytes]]
primitive relative of animals

## Four Major Groups
### Amoeboid
live in fresh or sea water & moist soils.
like [[Amoeba]], have [[Pseudopodia]] to move and capture prey
marine form- [[Silica]] shells,
some, (ex.*[[Entamoeba]]*) - paracytic
### Flagellated
have a [[Flagellum]], either 'free-living' or [[Saprophytes|Saprophytic]]. 
if parasytic, can be [[Pathogen]]s and cause [[Diseases]]:
- [[Sleeping Sickness]] (*[[Trypanosoma]]*)
### Cilliated![[Pasted image 20230807211541.png|right|200]]
- have thousands of [[Cillia]]. 
- Aquatic.
- water with food moved by cillia into cavity that opens to outside (gullet)
(ex. *[[Paramoecium]]*, image->)
### Sporozoans
Have [[Infectious Disease|infectious]] [[Spores|spore]]-like stage in life cycle
ex. [[Plasmodium]]/[[Malaria]]
