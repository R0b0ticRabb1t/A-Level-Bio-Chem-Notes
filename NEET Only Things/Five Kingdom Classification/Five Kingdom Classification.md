# Five Kingdom Classification
#biology #NCERT/11 #MOC 

Proposed by [[R.H. Whittaker]] in 1969, classifies all organisms into 5 [[Kingdom]]

| [[Plants]] | [[Animalia]]                                        | [[Monera]]              | [[Protista]]          | [[Fungi]]       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
| [[Cellulose]] [[Cell Walls]] | No wall                                             | Non cellulose wall      | maybe wall            | [[Chitin]]      |
| [[photosynthesis]]           | [[Heterotrophic]] ([[Holozoic]] or [[Saprophytes]]) | most modes of nutrition | Photo and Heterotroph | [[Saprophytes]] |
Monera & Protista are cellular, monera is the only [[Prokaryotic]] one 

Kinda old system, replaced by [[3 domain system]] now -; but i have to study this for neet

[[Viruses]], [[Viriods]], [[Prions]] & [[Lichens]] were not included back then
