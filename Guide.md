# Guide

This place is ~~kinda~~ very messy. i should make it a little bit more messy but i try to add some order for some reason

### Basic Rules
Note Size: ~50-100 words long
Try To put a tag on everything
When making notes from textbook, the ratio should be about:
for every 3 words in textbook, 1 word in note (including tags and shit)
Waypoints are sometimes used, since they make nice MOCs
### Common Unicode That i use often
| Uni | Code |
| --- | ---- |
| °   | b0   |
| ±   | b1   |
