# Guide.. please read this lol

This place is ~~kinda~~ very messy. i should make it a little bit more messy but i try to add some order for some reason

## Looking for someone to fill in the rest of AS level bio
AS [[Biology]] is only 1/3rd complete rn
but my as exams are over so.. don't think i'll have time
so i hope someone contributes
if you want to, my discord id is: robotic_rabbit

also for anyone doing AS and A levels, you can delete or ignore the notes tagged NEET

**DISABLE VIM PLEASE BEFORE USING UNLESS YOU KNOW VIM**
### Like a basic philosophy 
Try to make every note a reasonable size of ~50-100 words long
so its easy to review

When making notes from textbook, the ratio should be about:
for 3 words in the textbook, 1 word in the note (including tags and shit)

I sometimes use the waypoint plugin, since it makes nice MOCs
Banner plugin for aesthetics

### Spaced Repetition for other people
i used the spaced repetition plugin, which is basically flashcards but all of these notes
not that good but its nice and helps remember
if you want to use it first clear the previous data from me using it
i actually have no clue how to lol but i hope you can figure it out
if your smart use sed or maybe theres a way in properties idk

### Common Unicode That i use often
| Uni | Code | Latex              |
| --- | ---- | ------------------ |
| °   | b0   | $\degree$ \degrees |
| ±   | b1   | $\pm$ \pm          |
| ²   | b2   | $^2$ ^2            |
| ³   | b3   | $^3$ ^3            |
| µ   | b5   | $\micro$ \micro    |
| ·   | b7   |                    |
| α   | 3b1  | $\alpha$ \alpha    |
| β   | 3b2  | $\beta$ \beta      |
| ₁   | 2081 | $_1$ \_1           |
| ₂   | 2082 | $_2$ \_2           |

## Extra Tutorial
\# can be used for tags like #tag and also for headings if you put a space
more hashes = smaller headings
Obsidian is very customizable, rn it would be on my custom solarized config but you can go dark mode or pink or whatever you want
Export to HTML plugin is what i used for the website
its not good but its ok for now
later we will figure something better or forget about this

$ for latex
if you need it good luck
it works good for chem equations but not structures

[[]] for links, its pretty easy to use just read a bit
