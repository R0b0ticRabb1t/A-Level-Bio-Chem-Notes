# Guide 

This place is ~~kinda~~ very messy. i should make it a little bit more messy but i try to add some order for some reason

## Looking for someone to fill in the rest of AS level bio


### Like a basic philosophy 
Try to make every note a reasonable size of ~50-100 words long
so its easy to review

When making notes from textbook, the ratio should be about:
for 3 words in the textbook, 1 word in the note (including tags and shit)

I sometimes use the waypoint plugin, since it makes nice MOCs
Banner plugin for aesthetics

### Spaced Repetition for other people
