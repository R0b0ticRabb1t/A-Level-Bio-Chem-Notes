# Guide 

This place is ~~kinda~~ very messy. i should make it a little bit more messy but i try to add some order for some reason

### Basic Rules
Note Size: ~50-100 words long
Try To put a tag on everything
When making notes from textbook, the ratio should be about:
for every 3 words in textbook, 1 word in note (including tags and shit)
Waypoints are sometimes used, since they make nice MOCs
