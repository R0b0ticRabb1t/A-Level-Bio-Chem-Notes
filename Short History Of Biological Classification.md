# Short History Of Biological Classification
#biology #NCERT/11 

attempts were first instinctive and for necessity kinda

### First, [[Aristotle]]'s Attempt
Morphological characteristics only
Animals divided into red blood and not red blood

### At [[Carolus Linnaeus]]'s Time
**Two Kingdom**, **[[Plantae]]** and **[[Animalia]]** 
 - many don't fall into either
 - doesn't account for cell structure or evolution or other things well yet
Over time which organisms fit into these two has changed

### [[R.H. Whittaker]] (1969) - [[Five Kingdom Classification]]
