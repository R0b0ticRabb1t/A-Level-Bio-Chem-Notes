# Embryo Sac
#biology/plants #NCERT/12 

### Formation
The one functional megaspore (haploid?) divides by [[Mitosis]],
1 nucleate --> 2 -> 4 -> 8 nucleate (still no cell walls)

Then cell walls form and seperate the nuclei

The [[Synergids]] have specialized cell thickening:[[Filiform Apparatus]]
(important to remember micropylar and chalazal end)

Polar nuclei just lie in the big central cell, will become the [[endosperm]] later...
