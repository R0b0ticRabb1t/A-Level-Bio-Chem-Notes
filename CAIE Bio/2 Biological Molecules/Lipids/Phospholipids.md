### Phospholipids
#biology/biomolecules  

Have basically the same structure as [[Triglycerides]], but instead of 3 fatty acids, its **2 fatty acids** + *a [[phosphate group]]*.
This means that one end is [[Hydrophilic]]

Many things use this in their [[4 Cell Surface Membrane]]

**Micelles** bad spelling
