## Fatty Acids
#biology/biomolecules 

Fatty Acids are found in [[Lipids]]. 
They are defined as:
- [[Organic Molecules]]
- With a [[Carboxylic group (i)]]
	- this makes them an acid/allows forming [[Esters]] when combined with [[Alcohol]]

### Saturated Fatty Acids
- Have **maximum** hydrogen atoms
- No C=C double bonds
- Common in animals
### Unsaturated Fatty Acids
- Don't have max hydrogen atoms
	- **Monounsaturated** - one C=C double bond
	- **Polyunsaturated** - more double bonds
- This means they **melt easier**
	- because less [[Hydrogen Bonds]] are formed between molecules.
- Common in [[NEET Only Things/Plants/Plants]]
