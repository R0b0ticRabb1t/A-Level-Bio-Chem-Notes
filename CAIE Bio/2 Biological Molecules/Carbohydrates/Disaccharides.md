# Disaccharides

Disaccharides are [[Carbohydrates]] made of 2 [[Monosaccharides]] subunits.
They are joined together by a [[Glycosidic Bond]]

> [!example] Most Common Disaccharides
> [[Maltose]] : [[Glucose]] + [[Glucose]]
> [[Sucrose]] : Glucose + [[Fructose]]
> [[Galactose]] : Glucose + [[Lactose]]

Lots of theoretically possible disaccharides, only a few common in nature.

The Glycosidic bonds are determined by [[3 Enzymes]].
