# Polysaccharides

Polysaccharides are [[Polymers]], formed from the [[Polymerisation]] of many [[Monosaccharides]], with [[Glycosidic Bond]]s 

> [!info] Polysaccharides are not sugars
> Because they cannot be used quickly to release energy/
> They need to be [[Hydrolisis|Hydrolized]] before they can be used for energy release

Polysaccharides can be very big and long, forming [[Macromolecules]]
The most important polysaccharides are all made of [[Glucose]]:
- [[Starch]]
- [[Glycogen]]
- [[Cellulose]]
