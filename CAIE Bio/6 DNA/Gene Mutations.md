# Gene Mutations
#biology 

### Causes
- Errors during [[DNA replication]]
- Damage from [[Radiation]] or [[Carcinogens]] // **Mutagens** (things that cause things)
### Three types 
#### Substitution
One of the [[Nucleotides]] are changed. May change a single [[Amino Acids]] in the [[Protein]] chain. Might not change anything because redundancy of [[Amino Acids]] codes.
> [!Example] Eg: [[Sickle Cell Anaemia]]
#### Deletion / Insertion
This will change the entire chain afterwards as the remaining [[Codons]] are offset ( **Frame Shift Mutation** )
So this is more likely to be harmful.
