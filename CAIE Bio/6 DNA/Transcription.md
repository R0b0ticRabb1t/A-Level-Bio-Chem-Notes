# Transcription ([[6 DNA]] --> m[[RNA]])
#biology 

In the [[Nucleus]].
1. **RNA Polymerase** attatches to a [[Gene]] 
	- DNA unwinds, other enzyme unzips the specific part by breaking [[Hydrogen Bonds]] 
2. RNA Polymerase attatches to the 3' to 5' template strand 
3. **Complementary** mRNA copy is made (AGTC-->UCAG) (synthesized **5' to 3'**)

mRNA moves out of [[Nucleus]] through nuclear pores, and into Rough [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]] to [[Ribosomes]]
