# [[6 DNA]] replication
#biology 

Complicated process happens in the [[S Phase]]

1. DNA is unwound/unzipped and [[Hydrogen Bonds]] are broken
2. DNA Polymerase runs along one of the strands of [[6 DNA]], adding on [[Nucleotides]] to the **template parent strands**,
	- DNA Polymerase can only **synthesize in 5' to 3'** direction
	- So the leading strand is synthesized over a 3' to 5' template strand 
	- The other strand is **wound back** so that DNA Polymerase can synthesize in 5'-3' by going backwards on the 5'-3' lagging strand template
	- This causes the formation of [[Okazaki Fragments]]
3. Finally DNA [[Ligase]] binds strands together with [[Phosphodiester Bonds]] and attaches everything
