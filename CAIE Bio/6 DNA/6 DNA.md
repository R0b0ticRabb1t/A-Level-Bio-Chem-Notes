# DeoxyRibo-Nucleic-[[Acid]] (Deoxy[[RNA]])
#biology #MOC 

DNA contains the code for all living organisms to function.
Found in [[Nucleus]] of cell or just cytoplasm of [[Bacteria]]

Polymer made up of [[Nucleotides]], which pair with hydrogen bonds complementary to each other. 

-
	![[Nucleotides]]

Triplets of [[Nucleotides]] --> [[Codons]] (code for [[Amino Acids]])
Collection [[Codons]] --> [[Gene]] (codes for a single [[Protein]] chain)
5' to 3' strands run against each other in opposite complementary directions

DNA in [[Nucleus]] coils around [[Protein]] called [[histines]] which further coil into beaded threadlike structure known as [[Chromatin]], which are then coiled into [[Chromosomes]]
