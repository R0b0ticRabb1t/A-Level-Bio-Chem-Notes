## Nucleotides
#biology 

Nucleotides are the monomers of [[6 DNA]] and [[RNA]]
Made up of 1:
- Phosphate group
- [[Ribose]] [[Sugar]]
	- Carbons are numbered by their clockwise distance from O
- Nitrogenous Base

### Nitrogenous Bases
- Purines - Double Rings
	- Adenine
	- Guanine
- Pyramidines - Single Rings
	- Thymine
	- Cytosine
	- Uracil

#### Bonds between
Adenine -double [[Hydrogen Bonds]] - Thymine Or Uracil
Guanine -triple hydrogen bonds - Cytosine

Nucleotides themselves are bonded to each other by [[Phosphodiester Bonds]]
