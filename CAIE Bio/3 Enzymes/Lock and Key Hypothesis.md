### Lock and Key Hypothesis
1. [[3 Enzymes]] shaped exactly to fit [[substrate]]
2. Substrate/s held in place by the enzyme
	- forming **Enzyme-Substrate Complex**
3. By holding them in place, the reaction takes place faster
	- forming **Enzyme-Product Complex**
- The product detaches from the enzyme so that it can be used for another reaction

The [[Induced Fit Hypothesis]] is more accurate
