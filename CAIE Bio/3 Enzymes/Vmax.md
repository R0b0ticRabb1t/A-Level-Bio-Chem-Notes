## $V_{max}$
This is the fastest possible speed at which an [[3 Enzymes]] works,
At this speed each enzyme is *saturated* with a [[substrate]].

Measured by measuring initial rate of a reaction and adding more substrate concentration, [[Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity#of Substrate]]
Its not possible to reach Vmax in reality.. would require 
## $\frac{1}{2}V_{max}$
Using maths stuff that we don't know, we can find out half of the max speed, which is pretty useful to indicate the speed of the enzyme
this is used to define the [[Michaelis-Menten Constant]]
