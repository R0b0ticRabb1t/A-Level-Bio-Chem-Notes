# Viruses
#biology 

Viruses are technically not living cells, and are 50 times smaller than bacteria, ranging from **20-300nm**.
Characterized by *inert Crystalline Structure* outside of the living cell

Containing **only**: ![[Pasted image 20221005121701.png|right|300]]
- Self Replicating **[[6 DNA|DNA]] *xor* RNA**([[Retovirus]]) / Full Genome
	- Infect plant = usually Single Strand RNA
	- Infect animal = usually any RNA or Double strand DNA
	- Infect Bacteria = Bacteriophages, usually double strand DNA
- **Capsid**-Protective protein coat
	- Made of **Capsomere** Subunits 
	- Arranged in **Helical** or **Polyhedral** form
- **envelope** - Membraneish outer layer made of [[Phospholipids]] with proteins

Obligate parasites, only replicate by taking over another cell and using its machinery and killing the host cell in the process.

### Diseases Caused By Viruses
