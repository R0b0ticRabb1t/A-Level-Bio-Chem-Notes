# Viruses
#biology 

Viruses are technically not living cells, and are 50 times smaller than bacteria, ranging from **20-300nm**.

Containing **only**:
- Self Replicating **DNA or RNA**([[Retovirus]]) / Full Genome
- **Capsid**-Protective protein coat
- **envelope** - Membraneish outer layer made of [[Phospholipids]] with proteins

Always parasitic, only replicate by taking over another cell and using its protein synthesis to duplicate.
