# Lysosomes

Lysosomes are small sacs found within the cell, usually **0.5-1µm** long, created by [[Golgi Vesicles]] 
Contain [[3 Enzymes]] such as [[Hydrolases]] for breaking down unwanted substances.

### Four Functions
1. Destroy/digest unwanted materials
2. [[Endocytosis]]
	- Fusing with endocytic vacuoles
3. [[Exocytosis]]
	- Secretes enzymes out of the cell to carry out extracellular digestion
4. **Autolysis**
	- Releases enzymes into [[Cytoplasm]] to destroy the cell

### Form
Membrane bound [[Organelles]]
Keeps the digestive enzymes inside in order to protect rest of cell, and is acidic so that [[Hydrolisis]] occurs faster
