# Mitochondria

Mitochondria are 1Âµm diameter [[Organelles]] found in the cytoplasm, often connected to Rough [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]. 
### Functions
- Responsible for [[Aerobic Respiration]]
	- Releases **energy** from energy rich molecules, tansferring them to [[ATP]]
- And synthesizes some **lipids**
### Structure
- Is contained in 2 membrane layrs
	- Space between them is called **Intermembrane space**
	- Outer membrane is less permeable for H+, an adaptation for [[Oxidative Phosphorylation]]
- The inner layer folds inward in structures called **cristae**/**crista**.
	- This increases surface area for [[Oxidative Phosphorylation]]
- The inside of mitochondria is called the **matrix**
	- This is where **respiration** occurs
	- Contains [[3 Enzymes]] that allow this
- Can be any shape but usually sausage
