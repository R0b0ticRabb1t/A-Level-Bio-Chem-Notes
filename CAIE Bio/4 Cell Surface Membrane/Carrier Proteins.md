## Carrier Proteins
#biology 

Carrier [[Protein]] are [[Transport Proteins]], some which help in [[Facilitated Diffusion]] of substances across the [[4 Cell Surface Membrane]].

They achieve this by **switching** between **two different shapes/states**, instantaneously in the case of [[Facilitated Diffusion]], or use energy, for [[Active Transport]] and are known as [[Protein Pumps]]
