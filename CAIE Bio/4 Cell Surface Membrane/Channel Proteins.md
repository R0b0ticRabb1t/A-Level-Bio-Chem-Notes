## Channel Proteins
#biology 

Channel [[Protein]] are [[Transport Proteins]] that help in [[Facilitated Diffusion]] across the [[4 Cell Surface Membrane]].

They have **pores** that allow substances to go through more easily, mostly ions, such as in [[Nervous System]].
Some are '**gated**', have a part (inside surface of the membrane) that can move to close, to control the flow of ions, and **sometimes require energy**/[[ATP]] to operate.
Can be made up of a **single** protein or **multiple** proteins.
