## Factors Regulating Fluidity in Cell Membrane
#biology 

↑ temp == ↑kinetic energy and movement
↑ saturation of lipid tail = ↑ surface area/kinks = ↓ fluidity
↑ length of lipid tail = ↑ surface area = ↓ fluidity
#### [[Cholestrol]] - Mechanical Stability
Cholestrol makes the cell membrane a lot more stable
at low temps, cholestrol makes more fluid
at high temps, cholestrol makes less fluid
