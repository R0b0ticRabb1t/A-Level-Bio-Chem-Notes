# Osmosis
#biology 

Osmosis is [[Diffusion]] of water across a [[Partially Permeable Membrane]]/([[4 Cell Surface Membrane]]), down a water potential gradient.

Water potential is denoted by $\psi$, measured in kPa and depends on the concentration of solvent in water as well as the pressure of the water.
Always shown as negative, except pure water which will be 0kPa, and water moves from less negative to more negative.

| Water potential outside | [[Plant Cells]]                                                  | [[Animal Cells]]                                |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| greater than inside     | Become Turgid protected by [[Cell Walls]]                        | Water osmosizes into cell causing cell to burst |
| equal to inside         | [[Incipient Plasmolysis]]                                        | Animal cell is stable and functions properly    |
| less than inside        | Plasmolysed, [[Protoplast]] shrinks away from the [[Cell Walls]] | Water osmosizes out of cell, and cell shrinks   |
