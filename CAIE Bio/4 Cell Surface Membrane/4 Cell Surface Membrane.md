# Cell Surface Membrane
#biology #MOC 

Cell membrane in very important for cells to function.
- 7nm thick, electron microscope zoom shows 3 layers
	- 2 darker layers and 1 paler layer in the middle 
- Made up of [[Phospholipids]], also contains:
	- [[Cholestrol]]
	- [[Protein]]
	- [[Glycolipids]]
	- [[Glycoproteins]]

## Fluid Mosaic Model
- Phosophilipid molecules form a phosopholipid bilayer
	- ![[Pasted image 20221030182044.png]]
- Individual molecules can move freely side to side
- Mosaic because proteins are scattered and look like that

### Glyco stuff
Most proteins and phospholipids in the membrane have short [[Carbohydrates|carb]] chains attached to them for some purposes:
- [[Signalling receptors]]
- [[Cell to Cell recognition]]
- [[Cell Signalling]]
### Other things [[Protein]]s do
- Attach to [[Cytoskeleton]] maintain shape
- Enzymes
- [[Transport Proteins]]

## Transporting stuff across
- [[Diffusion]]
- [[Facilitated Diffusion]]
- [[Osmosis]]
- [[Active Transport]]
- [[Bulk Transport]]
