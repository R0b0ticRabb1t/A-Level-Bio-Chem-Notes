## Factors Regulating Fluidity in Cell Membrane
#biology 
#### Temperature
↑ temp == ↑kinetic energy and movement
#### Saturation of [[Fatty Acids]]/lipid tail in bilayer
↑ saturation = ↑ surface area = ↓ fluidity
#### Length of tail
↑ length = ↑ surface area = ↓ fluidity
#### [[Cholestrol]] - Mechanical Stability
Cholestrol makes the cell membrane a lot more stable
at low temps, cholestrol makes more fluid
at high temps, cholestrol makes less fluid
