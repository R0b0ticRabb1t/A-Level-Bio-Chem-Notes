# Osmosis
#biology 

Osmosis is [[Diffusion]] of water across a [[Partially Permeable Membrane]]/([[4 Cell Surface Membrane]]), down a water potential gradient.

Water potential is denoted by $\psi$, measured in kPa and depends on the concentration of solvent in water as well as the pressure of the water.
Always shown as negative, except pure water which will be 0kPa
