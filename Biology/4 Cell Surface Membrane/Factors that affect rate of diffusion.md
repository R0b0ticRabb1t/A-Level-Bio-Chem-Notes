## Factors that change the speeed of diffusion
#biology 

### Steepness of the [[Concentration Gradient]]
If the difference in concentration is more, then diffusion happens faster.
### Surface area (of the membrane)
More surface area--> more molecules can diffuse across at a time--> Faster Diffusion
[[Surface area to volume ratio]]
This limits cells to smaller size, because bigger cells would have too much volume for diffusion to be fast enough
### Temperature
More temperature --> more kinetic energy --> faster diffusion
### Size of molecules
Bigger molecules need more energy to move, and move slower, so are slower at diffusing than bigger molecules
### Type of Molecule
Some are just annoying and polar or nonpolar and can't diffuse across whatever
