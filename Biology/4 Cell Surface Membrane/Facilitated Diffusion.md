# Facilitated Diffusion
#biology

Larger polar molecules like [[Glucose]], [[Amino Acids]], as well as ions cannot diffuse across a [[4 Cell Surface Membrane]] normally.
Facillitated Diffusion uses [[Channel Proteins]] and [[Carrier Proteins]] to facillitate the diffusion.
Each protein is **specific** to one type of molecule.

### Factors affecting rate of facilitated diffusion
affected by the same as [[Factors that affect rate of diffusion]]
but also affected by number of proteins, and how many channel proteins are open.
also affected by the [[Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity]]/
