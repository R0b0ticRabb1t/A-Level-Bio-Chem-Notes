## Endocytosis
#biology 

This is a form of [[Active Transport]], requiring energy.
Opposite of [[Exocytosis]], this is outside cell to inside cell.

The [[4 Cell Surface Membrane]] englufs the material, forming a small [[Vesicle]]. 
Two types:
- [[Phagocytosis]] - solid
- [[Pinocytosis]] - liquid
	- usually small, lots of vesicles: micropinocytosis
