# Active Transport
#biology 

Active Transport is the process by which cells move substances **against** a [[Concentration Gradient]]. 
Requires energy in the form of [[ATP]], and is accomplished by [[Protein Pumps]]. Protein pumps are very specific to one substance.
### Steps
- The specific substance binds to the protein pumps.
- With the help of energy from atp the shape of the protein pump
	- ATP is broken down into ADP and inorganic phosphate to release energy [[ATPase Enzyme]]
- Change of shape causes the molecule to be released on the other side of the membrane

### [[Endocytosis]] and [[Exocytosis]] are also forms of bulk active transport
