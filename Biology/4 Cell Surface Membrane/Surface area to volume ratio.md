## Surface Area To Volume Ratio

An increase in volume creates a much larger increase in volume
for demonstration:
we'll take cubic cells for simplicity

1 unit, 6 unit area but 1 in volume
2 unit, 12 unit area but 8 in volume
3 unit, 18 unit area but 27 in volume

surface area increases linearly, 6,12,18, 6n
volume increases exponentially, 1,8,27, n^3
