# Diffusion
#biology nnn
Diffusion is the **net movement** of substances from an area of high to low concentration/ across a concentration gradient.
Its caused by the random motion of particles, [[Brownian Motion]]


[[Osmosis]] is diffusion specifically for [[Water]] across a semi permeable membrane

### Diffusion across Cell Membrane
Small Molecules such as [[Oxygen]], [[Carbon Dioxide]] and other nonpolar molecles can easily diffuse across, as they dissolve in the [[Phospholipids]].
[[Water]] can also diffuse across, because it is small enough.

### ![[Factors that affect rate of diffusion]]
