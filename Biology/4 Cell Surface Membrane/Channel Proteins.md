## Channel Proteins
#biology 

Channel [[Proteins]] are [[Transport Proteins]] that help in [[Facilitated Diffusion]] across the [[4 Cell Surface Membrane]].

They have pores that allow substances to go through more easily, mostly ions, such as in [[Nervous System]].
Some are 'gated', have a part (inside surface of the membrane) that can move to close, to control the flow of ions, and sometimes require energy/[[ATP]] to operate.
Can be made up of a single protein or multiple proteins.
