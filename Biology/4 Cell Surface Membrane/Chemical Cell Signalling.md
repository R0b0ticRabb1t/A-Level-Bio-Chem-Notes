# Cell Signalling (with chemicals) 
#biology 

## Steps:
1. Stimulus causes cell to secrete a [[Ligand]]
2. [[Ligand]] is transported to cells
3. Binds to [[Signalling receptors]] in [[4 Cell Surface Membrane]]
5. [[Transmembrane]] receptor changes shape
6. Shape change allows interacting with the next component
#### Transduction
Signal is converted from one method of transmission to another
### Ways receptors alter cell activity
- Opening ion [[Channel Proteins]] ([[Nicotine-Accepting acetylcholine receptors]])
- Act as membrane bound enzyme ([[Glucagon Receptor]])
- Act as intracellular receptor after initial signal goes through membrane
- #### G proteins
	- Acts as switch, releases many second messengers
	- signal is amplified
	- signalling cascade
	- final response activates some enzyme:
