# Transport In Plants
#MOC #biology/plants 

Plants make their own food with [[photosynthesis]].
Photosynthesis needs: 
- Light - So leaves are at the top of the plant
- CO2 - also absorbed through leaves
- Water   - found in soil
- Minerals - ||

Water and minerals have to be transported from the soil and roots up to leaves, and the products of photosynthesis need to be transported downward
