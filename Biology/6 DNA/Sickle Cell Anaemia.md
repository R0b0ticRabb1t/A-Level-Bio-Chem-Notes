## Sickle Cell Anaemia
#biology 

This is a [[Genetic Disease]], that affects [[Haemoglobin]] in [[Red Blood Cells]].

One of the [[Amino Acids]] in a Î²-globin, [[Glutamic Acid]] (polar), is substituted with [[Valine]] (Non-Polar). This affects the [[Weak Hydrophobic interactions]], making haemoglobin less soluble.
