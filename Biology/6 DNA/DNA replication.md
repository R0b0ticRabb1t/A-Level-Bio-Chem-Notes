# [[6 DNA]] replication
#biology 

Complicated process happens in the [[S Phase]]

- DNA is unwound/unzipped and [[Hydrogen Bonds]] are broken
- DNA Polymerase runs along one of the strands of [[6 DNA]], adding on [[Nucleotides]] to the **template parent strands**,
	- DNA Polymerase can only synthesize in 5' to 3' direction
	- So the leading strand is synthesized over a 3' to 5' template strand 
	- The other strand is wound back so that DNA Polymerase can synthesize in the right direction part by part 
	- This forms [[Okazaki Fragments]]
- Finally DNA [[Ligase]] binds strands together with [[Phosphodiester Bonds]]
