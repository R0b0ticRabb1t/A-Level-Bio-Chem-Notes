# Ribo-Nucleic [[Acids]] (RNA)
#biology 

Basically just [[6 DNA]] but with more [[Oxygen]] atoms in its [[Sugar]].
Made of the same [[Nucleotides]] *except* for [[Thymine]] which is replaced with [[Uracil]] instead.
Also only *single stranded*

There are different types of RNA:
- ### mRNA
	- messenger RNA made during [[Transcription]]
	- single stranded and unfolded, moves out from [[Nucleus]]
- ### tRNA
	- transfer RNA used to help in [[Translation]]
	- folds into a specific shape, attaches to specific [[Amino Acids]] with help of certain [[3 Enzymes]]
	- always has CCA codon at the start, and a specific anticodon to bind to mRNA [[Codons]] 

- ### rRNA
	- ribosmal RNA is RNA that makes up part of the [[Ribosomes]]
	- folds into 2 complex shapes
