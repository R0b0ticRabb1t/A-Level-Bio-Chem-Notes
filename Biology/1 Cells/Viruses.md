# Viruses
#biology 

Viruses are technically not living cells, and are 50 times smaller than bacteria, ranging from 20-300nm.

Containing only:
- Self Replicating DNA or RNA / Full Genome
- **Capsid** Protective protein coat
- Membraneish outer layer made of [[Phospholipids]] 

Always parasitic, only replicate by taking over another cell and using its protein synthesis to duplicate.
