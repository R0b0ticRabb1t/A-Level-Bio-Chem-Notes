# Cells
#MOC #biology 

Cells are the basic unit of life.
Discovered by Robert Hooke first.

Cells are 'bags' of chemicals that allow life to happen, and are contained inside [[4 Cell Surface Membrane|cell membrane]].

Cells usually have a size between 5µm and 40µm, so can only be seen under [[Microscopes]]. Cell contents are often colorless and transparent, so coloured dyes are used to stain them in order to be obeserved.
