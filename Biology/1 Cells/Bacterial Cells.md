#biology 

Bacteria are [[Prokaryotic]] single-celled organisms, usually 1000 times smaller in volume.

They contain:
- [[Cell Walls]], contains peptidoglycan, prevents bursting
- [[4 Cell Surface Membrane]]
- [[Cytoplasm]]
	- But no double-membrane bounded organelles
- [[Ribosomes]]
- Circular [[DNA]]
	- not membrane bound nucleus
	- found in a region called nucleoid instead along with [[RNA]] and proteins
and somtimes contain:
- [[Flagellum]] to swim
- Infolding of cell membrane
	- [[photosynthesis]]
	- [[Nitrogen Fixation]]
- Capsule and slime for extra protection
- [[Plasmids]]
- Pili/pilus
	- Protein rods that allow connecting to other cells for transfer of substances or sexual reproduction
