# Lysosomes

Lysosomes are small sacs found within the cell, usually **0.5-1Âµm** long.
Contain [[3 Enzymes]] such as [[Hydrolases]] for breaking down unwanted substances.

### Four Functions
1. Destroy/digest unwanted materials
2. [[Endocytosis]]
3. Exocytosis
	- Secretes enzymes out of the cell to carry out extracellular digestion
4. Autolysis
	- Releases enzymes into [[Cytoplasm]] to destroy the cell

### Form
Membrane bound [[Organelles]]
Keeps the digestive enzymes inside in order to protect rest of cell, and is acidic so that [[Hydrolisis]] occurs faster
