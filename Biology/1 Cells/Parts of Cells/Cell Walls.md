## Cell Walls
#biology 

### Structure
Cell walls are made out of parallel [[Cellulose]] fibres, that run through each other in a matrix of other [[Polysaccharides]]. There are usually many layers of this, and in a layer the fibres are parallel.
Sometimes contain **lignin** for more strength.

### Functions
1. Support the Cell
2. Prevent cell from exploding from osmosis of water
3. Orientations determine the shape of plant growth
4. [[Apoplast]] and [[Plasmodesmata]]
5. Waxy cuticle reduces water loss
