# Microtubules

Microtubules are small(25µm) tubes, found in most [[1 Cells]]

### Functions
- Provide structure and support/ Make up the [[Cytoskeleton]]
- Transportation of certain vesicles and [[Organelles]] along the outside surfaces
- Form part of [[Centrioles]]
- Used during [[Cell division]] as a spindle for seperation of [[Chromosomes]]
- Used in [[Cillia]] and [[Flagellum]] movements

## Structure
Made of [[Proteins]] called **tubulin** and a few other filaments.
Two types of tubulin:
- α-tubulin
- β-tubulin
Both of these combine to form a **dimer** or double molecule.
And dimers are attached in rings of 13, which connect to form tubes known as **protofilaments**.
This occurs in [[MTOC]]s, or microtubule organising centers, through [[Polymerisation]].
