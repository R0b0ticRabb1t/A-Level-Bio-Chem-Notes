# Cillia

Cillia are highly complex structures (600+ [[Proteins]]), which allows them to have fine control over their speed of beating. They are extensions of many [[Eukaryotic]] cells, and are surrounded by the [[4 Cell Surface Membrane]].
## Structure
Identical structure to [[Flagellum]]
The base is a copy of [[Centriole]]s, and is called the **basal body**. 
Whole structure within membrane is called **axoneme**.

It is an almost hollow tube, consisting of 2 central microtubules and 9 pairs/**microtubule doublets (MTDs)** arranged around.

#### [[Microtubules|Microtuble]] doublets
These are pairs of 2 microtubule, A and B, where B is incomplete with only 10/3.
##### Arms
Each A microtube has 2 arms made out of **dynein** proteins.

## Beating 
The arms made of dynein, can touch and move along other microtubules, producing force to move, while other parts of the cillia bend.
## Functions
#### Movement
Allows single celled organisms to move
#### In [[Epithelial Cells]]
Found in airways, maintain flow of [[mucus]], as liquids and objects that it can move are pushed .
