# Endoplasmic Reticulum
#biology 

- These are that are found in cells, and are continuous with the outer layer of the [[Nucleus#Nuclear Envelope|Nuclear Envelope]]. 
- The membranes form flattened sacs/**[[cisternae]]** 
- Reactions can also occur inside the cisternae
- They can transport substances, especially [[Proteins]] seperate from the [[Cytoplasm]]. 
- Two Types: RER and SER

## RER (Rough endoplasmic reticulum)
These are rough because they have many [[Ribosomes]] covering them that show up as black dots in the microscope

## SER (Smooth endoplasmic reticulum)
Are smoother and have a different purpose. 
- Makes [[Lipids]] and steroids
- Stores calcium
	- so is used more in muscel cells
