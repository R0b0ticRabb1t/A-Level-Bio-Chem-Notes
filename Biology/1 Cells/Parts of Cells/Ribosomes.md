# Ribosomes

### What they are
Ribosomes are sites for synthesis of [[Proteins]]. 
They are too small to be seen with a light microscope ~ 25Âµm
Can be found in the [[Cytoplasm]] or on the surface of [[Endoplasmic Reticulum#RER Rough endoplasmic reticulum|RER]].

### Sizes
For structures this small [[Svedberg units]] are used to measure them. 
- [[Eukaryotic]]-80S size
- [[Prokaryotic]]-70S size
[[Mitochondria]] and [[Chloroplasts]] also contain 70S ribosomes, is proof of [[Endosymbiont Theory]]

### Structure
- We can see they consist of 2 subunits, one large and one small.  
- Contain equal amounts of [[Proteins]] and [[RNA#rRNA]]
