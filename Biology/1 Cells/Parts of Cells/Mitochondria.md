# Mitochondria

Mitochondria are 1Âµm diameter [[Organelles]] found in the cytoplasm, often connected to Rough [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]. 
### Functions
- Responsible for [[Aerobic Respiration]]
	- Releases energy from energy rich molecules, tansferring them to [[ATP]]
- And synthesizes some lipids
### Structure
- Is contained in 2 membrane layrs
	- Space between them is called **Intermembrane space**
- The inner layer folds inward in structures called **cristae**/**crista**.
- The inside of mitochondria is called the matrix
	- This is where respiration occurs
	- Contains [[3 Enzymes]] that allow this
- Can be any shape but usually sausage
