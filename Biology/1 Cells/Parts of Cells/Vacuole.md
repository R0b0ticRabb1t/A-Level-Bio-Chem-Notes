# Vacuoles

Vacuoles are membrane bound [[Organelles]],kinda like cooler [[Lysosomes]].
They are covered by tonoplast.
### In [[Animal Cells]]
- [[phagocytic]] vacuoles
- food vacuoles
- autophagic vacuoles
### In [[Plant Cells]]
In plants there is a large central vacuole
#### Functions
- Support, Vacuoles increase in size as water [[Osmosis]]e into it, filling up the cell and making it turgid
  also makes the cell grow/supports structure of the plant
- Does things that [[Lysosomes]] do
- **Secondary Metabolites** - unnessential chemicals
	- **Anthocynins** for pigments
	- **alkaloids and tannins** deter herbivores
- Food reserves, store sucrose, or minerals
- Waste products
