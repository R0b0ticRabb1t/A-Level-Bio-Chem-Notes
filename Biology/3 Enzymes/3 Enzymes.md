# Enzymes
#biology #MOC 

Enzymes are biological [[Catalysts]], very important for organisms to function.

>[!important] They are [[Protein]] that are globular in structure, that catalyze almost all reactions in living things, by reducing their *activation energy*.

- [[Intracellular Enzymes]]
- [[Extracellular Enzymes]]
	- The enzymes are secreted outside to digest substances ex
		- [[Fungi]]
		- [[Lysosomes]]/[[Stomach]]
- [[Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity]]
### How Enzymes Work
In both hypothesis, each enzyme can only catalyzes a single reaction. But the actual reaction speed increase can be very high.
By reducing activation energy, they allow the reactions to occur much faster than would otherwise occur at that temperature.
Enzymes are too small to see exactly how they work.
