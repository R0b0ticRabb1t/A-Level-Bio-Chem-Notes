Substances that are similar to substrate an [[3 Enzymes]] was made for, and binds to the active site instead of the correct substrate.

So if the concentration of this inhibitor is more than that of the substrate, the reaction will be slow
Can be fixed by increasing the concentration of the correct substrate.
