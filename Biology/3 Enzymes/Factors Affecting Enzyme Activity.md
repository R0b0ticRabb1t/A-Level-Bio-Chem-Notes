# Factors Affecting Enzyme Activity
#biology 

### Measuring Enzyme Activity
[[Measuring Rate of Product Formation]]
[[Colorimeter]]
### Temperature
| ![[Pasted image 20221111095702.png\|400]] |Enzymes usually have an <br>optimal temp of 40°-60°<br>at too low temps <br>particles move slower<br> so the substrate doesn't <br>collide with the enzyme as often      |
| ----------------------------------------- | --- |
#### Enzymes Denatures at high temperatures
The bonds that keep enzymes in a precise shape start to break, so
- the shape of the enzyme changes
- Substrate doesn't fit well
- Eventually not fitting at all, and enzyme stops working
### [[pH level]]
| ![[Pasted image 20221111100913.png\|400]] | optimum pH varies<br> a little bit more<br>most work best at pH 7<br> pepsin - 1.5 pH | 
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
$\ce{H+}$ and $\ce{OH-}$ ions can interact with the R groups of charged [[Amino Acids]] in the enzyme, and break the ionic bonds that hold the shape together, resulting in the enzyme denaturing.
### Concentration 
For investigating concentration, we have to first plot the graph of rate of reaction for multiple concentrations.
Then plot graph of only initial rate of reaction, since later rates are affected by change in substrate concentration
#### of Enzyme
More enzyme --> Faster reaction
Linear Increase in initial rate of change
#### of Substrate
More substrate--> faster reactions..
But at some point the enzyme active sites get filled up, and they cannot work any faster.. 
This is called [$V_{max}$](Vmax.md), the maximum rate of an enzyme reaction
