#biology #MOC 

This is how cells divide through mitosis. Its a continuos cycle, end of life of one cell begins the life of two new daughter cells, repleneshing the constant death of cells, very important.

[[Plant Cells]] have the same thing with 2 differences:
- No [[Centrosome]]
- [[Cell Walls]] need to be created
but we'll focus on [[Animal Cells]]

### Steps of the Cycle
- [[Interphase]]
- [[M phase]] or [[Mitosis]]
- [[Cytokinesis]]

### Important Structures:
- [[Chromosomes]]
- [[Nucleus]]
- [[Microtubules]]
- [[Centrosome]]s
