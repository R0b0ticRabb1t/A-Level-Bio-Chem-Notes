# Stem Cells
#biology 

Cells that have the ability to divide an unlimited number of times through [[Mitosis]]. Only matter in [[Animal Cells]] since [[Plant Cells]] can dedifferentiate

- First 16 embryonic stem cells are **totipotent** and can divide into any type of cell
- Next cells divide into [[placenta]] or lose that ability,
  now **pluripotent** and divide into any other type of cell
- More differentiated/specialized cells have less ability to divide

Adult stem cells lose potency and are **multipotent**
