# Cellulose
#biology [[2 Biological Molecules]] [[Polysaccharides]]

Cellulose fibres are inelastic and have a high [[tensile strength]], and is used for structural roles in [[Plants]].
### Structure of Cellulose
Cellulose is also made out of [[Glucose]] subunits, but unlike other [[Carbohydrates]], it uses the Î²-glucose ![[Glucose#^ef14a9]]

The change in direction results in each molecule having to be rotated when forming bonds. ![[Pasted image 20221019082740.png|500]]


#### How they are so strong

The [[Glycosidic Bond]] at the top instead of the bottom means that there are more [[Hydrogen Bonds]] that are formed between molecules, and the cellulose is much stronger.
A bundle of 60-70 cellulose fibres become [[Microfibrils]], and bundles of them create the fibre.
