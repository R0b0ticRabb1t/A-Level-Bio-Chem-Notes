# Disaccharides

Disaccharides are [[Carbohydrates]] made of 2 [[Monosaccharides]] subunits.
They are joined together by a [[Glycosidic Bond]]

> [!example] Most Common Disaccharides
> [[Maltose]] : [[Glucose]] + [[Glucose]]
> Sucrose : Glucose + Fructose
> Galactose : Glucose + Lactose

Lots of theoretically possible disaccharides, only a few common in nature.

The Glycosidic bonds are determined by [[3 Enzymes]].
