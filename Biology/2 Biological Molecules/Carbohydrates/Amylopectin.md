## Amylopectin
#biology/biomolecules  

Amylopectin is similar in structure to [[Amylose]]:

![[Amylose#^4c7e0d]]![[Amylose#Structure]]

Basically amylose, but it has shorter chains and also a few 1,6 links that create branching paths.
Has the same structure of [[Glycogen]], but with fewer branches. ^0705af
