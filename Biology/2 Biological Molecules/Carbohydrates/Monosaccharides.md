# Monosaccharides

Monosaccharides are the simplest [[Carbohydrates]].

>[!Formula]
>#### General Formula: $\ce{(CH2O)_n}$

### Types of Monosaccharides
Monosaccharides are classified in terms of number of carbon atoms
- Triose 3C
- Pentose 5C
	- Ribose
	- Deoxyribose
- Hexose 6C
	- [[Glucose]]
	- Fructrose
	- Galactose
### Rings
Pentoses and Hexoses are long enough that they they can loop and form a more stable ring structure
### Functions
- Release energy in [[Aerobic Respiration]]
	- Lots of bonds C-H bonds which can be broken to release energy to make [[ATP]] from [[ADP]]
- Building blocks for large molecules such as [[Polysaccharides]] and [[Disaccharides]]
