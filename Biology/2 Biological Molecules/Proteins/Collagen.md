## Collagen
#biology/biomolecules 

Collagen is an insoluble [[Fibrous Protein]], and is the most common protein in animals. Makes up [[Connective Tissues]]

Has a high [[tensile strength]]
### Structure 
Each molecule of collagen is made of 3 [[Protein|polypeptide chains]], wound in a triple helix structure, very tightly held together with [[Hydrogen Bonds]].
Its able to be tight because every three/inner amino group is [[Glycine]], which is small enough to fit/ allow this triple helix.

This molecule then lines up and covalently bonds to other triple helixes (staggered so that there are no weak points), forming fibrils.

Many fibrils lie side by side to form a collagen fibre.
