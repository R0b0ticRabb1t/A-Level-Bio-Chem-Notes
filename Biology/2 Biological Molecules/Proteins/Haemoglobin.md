# Haemoglobin
#biology/biomolecules 

Haemoglobin is an important [[Proteins|protein]], which carries [[Oxygen]] through the blood. 
### Structure of Haemoglobin
Haemoglobin has a [[Structure of Proteins#Quartenary Structure|Globular Structure]] composed of 4 polypeptide chains, 2 α-globin and 2 β-globin.
The [[Weak Hydrophobic interactions ]], are very specific to allow dissolving in water. Incorrect amino acids tamper with this causing [[Sickle Cell Anaemia]]

#### Haem Group
Each globin chain contains one of these [[Prosthetic groups]], containing 1 iron atom that can reversibly bind to a full oxygen molecule
4 haem groups --> 4 $\ce{O2}$ molecules --> 8 [[Oxygen]] atoms.
This causes the red colour, and is more bright red when oxygen is bounded (oxyhaemoglobin)
