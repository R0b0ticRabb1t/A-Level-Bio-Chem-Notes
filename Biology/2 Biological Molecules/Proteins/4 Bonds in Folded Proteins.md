## Types of Bonds Which Hold tert Structure Of Proteins 

##### [[Hydrogen Bonds]]
1. between **very polar groups**
2. weak alone strong together?
##### **[[Disulfide Bonds]]** 
1. Strong Covalent bonds
2. Between [[Cysteine]] molecules
3. $\ce{S-H + H-S\xrightleftharpoons[-H2]{+H2} S-S + H2}$ 
4. Broken by [[Reducing Agents]]
##### [[Ionic Bonds]]
1. Between $\ce{NH3^+ , COO^-}$ 
2. Broken by [[pH level]] changes,
##### [[Weak Hydrohpobic interactions]]
1. weak, yet still affects shape
2. Non Polar/[[Hydrophobic]] R groups face inwards,
3. Polar/[[Hydrophilic]] R groups face outwards
