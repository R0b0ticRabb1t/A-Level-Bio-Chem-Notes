# Structure of Proteins
### Primary Structure
This is the sequence of [[Amino Acids]]. A change in a single amino acid can change the entire protein
### Secondary Structure
Proteins fold because of [[Hydrogen Bonds]] between the CO and NH molecules in them, causing them fold/bend forming the secondary structure, which can vary.
- ##### α-helix structure
  Each NH is attracted to the O=C four steps in front of the sequence with hydrogen bonds, causing the polypeptide to coil
  Represented as coils
- ##### β-pleated sheet structure
  Sheet like structure, hydrogen bonds between parallel polypeptide chains
  Represented as Arrows
Random Coils are represented as ribbons
### Tertiary Structure
The secondary structure folds and coils in on itself further to form a very precise 3d molecule, held in place with different types of bonds between amino acids [[4 Bonds in Folded Proteins]]
### Quartenary Structure
This is when multiple polypeptide chains interect/join together to perform a single function

- ##### [[Globular Protein]]
  They form a *globular* shape
  Can usually dissolve in water, because of the [[[Weak Hydrohpobic interactions in folded proteins]].
  > [!Example] Eg:[[Haemoglobin]]

- ##### [[Fibrous Protein]]
  Long strands
  Not soluble in water
  > [!example] Eg; [[Collagen]]
