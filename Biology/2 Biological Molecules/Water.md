# Water $\ce{H2O}$
#biology/biomolecules
### Important Facts
- Most abundant molecule of living bodies
	- Humans are 60% water
	- [[1 Cells]] are 70-95% water
- Water covers 3/4th of the [[Earth]]'s surface
## Physical Properties of Water
Water exhibits [[Hydrogen Bonds|Hydrogen Bonding]], which affects its physical properties:
- Higher [[Latent Heat]] of vaporization and fusion than similar small molecules
- Higher [[Specific Heat Capacity]]
- Expands when freezing
- Great [[solvent]], dissolves any polar molecules

### How these affect [[Biology]]
Waters ability to dissolve polar molecules makes it an ideal medium for all biological reactions.
Since it takes more energy to change temperature/state of water, it is more stable, and allows biological reactions to occur at a steady rate.
Inability to dissolve non-polar molecules /hydrophobic interactions important for [[Protein]] and [[Lipids]]
