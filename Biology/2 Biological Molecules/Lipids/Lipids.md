# Lipids
#biology/biomolecules 

Lipids are [[Organic Molecules]] that don't dissolve in water, but do disolve in other solvents.
Often used to store energy and for other functions in animals and plants.

### Types of Lipids
- Fats- Solid at room temperature
- Oils- Liquid at room temperature
Another method of categorization:
- [[Triglycerides]] - Most lipids are triglycerides
- [[Phospholipids]] - Kinda special 

### Emulsion Test for lipids
1. Dissolve in pure [[Ethanol]]
2. Then pour the solution into water
3. Solution will turn cloudy if lipids are present
