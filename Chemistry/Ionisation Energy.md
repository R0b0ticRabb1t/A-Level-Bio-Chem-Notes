# Ionisation Energies
This is the amount of energy that it takes to take out an electron from an atom. 
> [!info] Symbol for this is **IE**, and is measured in units of **kg/mol** or **kg mol$^{-1}$**

### First ionization energies
 
This is the amount of energy required to remove one electron in a [[mole]] of the element in its gaseous state.
or
> [!tldr] Amount of energy needed to make 1 mole of +1 gaseous ions of the element.

### Successive ionization energies
After the first ionization energy, the next ionization energies are higher because have greater attraction to the nucleus. 
They are represented by IE$_2$, IE$_3$ and so on.

The sudden jump in ionisation energy is evidence of the [[Simple Electron Structure]]

We can use successive ionisation energies in this way to:
- predict or confirm the simple electronic configuration of elements
- confirm the number of electrons in the outer shell
- find the group the element belongs to
