# Atoms

Atoms are the the smallest part of a substance that can take part in a *chemical change*. They are very small, and have very little mass.

### Atomic Structure
All of the atoms mass is concentrated in the nucleus of the atom. This contains protons and neutrons.

[[Electrons]] orbit the nucleus in [[Electron Orbitals]], but we use the [[Electron Sub Shells]] model for simplification.

|        | Neutrons | Protons | Electrons |
| ------ | -------- | ------- | --------- |
| Charge | 0        | 1       | -1        |
| Symbol | n        | p       | e         |
| Mass   | 1        | 1       | 1/1836    |

We know the charges by an experiment which shows that electrons are repulsed by a negative charge while protons are attracted by it while neutrons are not affected at all.
