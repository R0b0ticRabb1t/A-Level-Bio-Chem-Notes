## Carbocations
#chemistry 

Carbocations are positively charged carbon atoms, (positive charge= [[Cation]])

### Carbocation Degree $\propto$ Stability
Carbocations are described by degrees, 1° means the carbocation is connect to only 1 other carbon,2°, 2 adjacent carbon atoms, 3°, 3 carbon atoms.

Higher degree is more stable because of the [[Inductive Effect]]
