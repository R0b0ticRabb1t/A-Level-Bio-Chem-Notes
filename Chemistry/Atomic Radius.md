## Atomic Radius
This refers to the size of an atom

Atomic radius increases down the group because there are more electron shells, so more sheilding. 
It decreases across periods because protons increase, but electrons stay on the same shell and there is no difference in sheilding. More nuclear charge, so electrons come closer to the nucleus.
