### Simple electron structure
Electrons are configured into quantum [[Electron Sub Shells]]. 
These are arranged outside the nucleus into **Energy Levels**. 

The **principal energy levels** are arranged into how far away they are from the nucleus. 
Further away from the nucleus:
- electrons have more energy 
- held less tightly to the nucleus

Each principal energy shell can hold a set number of electrons.

| Shell | Max electrons |
| ----- | ------------- |
| n=1   | 2             |
| n=2   | 8             |
| n=3   | 18            |
| n=4   | 32            |

### Evidence for electron structure
Scientists worked out the amount of energy needed to knock out electrons in atoms, by firing electrons at high speeds. The energy change here is the [[Ionisation Energy]].
