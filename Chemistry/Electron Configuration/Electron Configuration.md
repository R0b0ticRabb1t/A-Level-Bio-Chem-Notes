# Electron Configuration

i made this mostly as a waypoint because it is a very big topic in chem 
#chemistry 

but while im here might as well give a rundown
In an atom there are [[Simple Electron Structure|Principal Electron Shells]], which are shells certain distances from the nucleus. Those are divided into [[Electron Sub Shells]], which contain [[Electron Orbitals]]

%% Begin Waypoint %%
- [[Electron Orbitals]]
- [[Electron Sub Shells]]
- [[Filling Electron subshells]]
- [[Simple Electron Structure]]

%% End Waypoint %%
