# Electron Sub Shells

The [[Simple Electron Structure|Principal Electron Shells]] are divided further into sub shells. 

Different types of sub shells are assigned different letters

- s - 2 electrons
- p - 6 electrons
- d - 10 electrons
- f - idk
and so on

Each of these contain their own [[Electron Orbitals]]

### Electron Sub Shells in different energy levels
Principal Energy Level --> number of shells
They are also filled in different ways, as electrons fill the shells that take the least energy

i try to explain more in [[Filling Electron subshells]]
