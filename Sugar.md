## Sugar
#biology #biology/biomolecules 

Sugars are small [[Carbohydrates]], ([[Monosaccharides]] and [[Disaccharides]] , poly is too big). tastes sweet 

### Reducing Sugars 
These are [[Reducing Agents]], and can be oxidized. All [[Monosaccharides]] and a few [[Disaccharides]] are reducing sugars ([[Sucrose]] is not a reducing sugar.

## Tests for Sugars 
#### Benedicts tests 
Heat with benedicts reagent brick red colour.
$\ce{sugar + Cu^2+ (blue) -> oxidized sugar + Cu^+(red brown)}$ 
#### Non reducing Sugars 
first has to go through [[Hydrolisis]] (HCl boiling, then neutralize so benedicts reagent can work in alkaline condition)
