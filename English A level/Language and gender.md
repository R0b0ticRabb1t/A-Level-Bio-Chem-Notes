## Language and gender
#english/research

- [[The first paragraph on wikipedia about language and gender]]

so hmm what to focus on ???

how about just the parts that interest me ?
this is probably just going to be what i already know about

- so how different languages have more words that are about gender
	- like how spanish or french has like every single word gendered and its really confusing
	- but then english only has a few pronouns and like feminine connotations? 
	- and then some other places have even fewer gendered terms i think?
	- i checked wikipedia about japan pronouns
		- its very documented like theres a very long list of all the pronouns, their meanings, its nice
		- its very different to how english does it
		- like they have 'boku' and 'atashi' which are gendered self pronouns 
		- "Some linguists consider the description of "rough–soft continuum" more accurate than the description of "male–female continuum"
- is there a difference between how men and woman talk? idk 
	- damn theres like a ton of theories about this
	- most of them was like written about last century by feminist movements
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nL7hMHCuJz0 i watched this at like 3x speed theres a lot of people names
	- apparently women makes more 'mmm's and 'oh's and 'yeah's 
	- slayy 
- maybe theres another difference between how they talk with people of the opposite gender and their own gender
- oh yeah also like how different words are interpreted as masculine or feminine and why
	- nice personal example: for some reason my name has been interpreted both ways,, 
		- maybe its because it starts and ends with an A
		- since when someone, especially indian people, does know that im male they usually say Anirudh instead of Anirudha
		- same for my voice when i was younger
	- This is apparently called grammatical gender
