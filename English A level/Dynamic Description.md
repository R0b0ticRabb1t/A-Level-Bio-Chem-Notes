The clock strikes 5. 
The typewriters around me stop clicking, the people around me get up and leave.
~~I sit for a while. im not sure why, but it seems like I've started to realize something. 
Nope, I've lost it. no clue what I was thinking of. 'oh well' I think to myself. ~~
I leave the office last, passing by the bland, dull yellow walls and into the streets. Almost immediately, I'm pushed around by the ceaseless rush hour crowd. My ears are filled by tick of endless footsteps. Its like being pushed by the endless conveyor belt of society, the same one that got me to this point in the first place. For a moment, like everybody else, I think about nothing other than going home, eating dinner, the work I'm going to have to do tmrw. The same page of this book being read over and over again until I retire. 
today I stop.
instead of continuing to walk with the crowd, I come to a stop beside a tree and look around me.
I sit down, underneath the lone and aged tree, facing the sunset. There are no birds or clouds in the sky, the air is still and humid, and all I can see for miles in front of me are the same old buildings, the same inoffensive colors, the pThe dimming sun casts a dull yellow color on practically everything, like a painting shaded entirely in a single color. There are hundreds of people around me, each one minding their own business, moving in the same direction as everyone else, walking at the same pace, with the same tired expression on their faces, just wanting to get home after a grueling 9-5 workday. everybody seems to blend into everyone else. 
I've seen most of these people at least a hundred times before, yet I still don't know a single one of their names. I recognize their faces, what they do, where they work, but I have no clue who they actually are.
 
I think to myself: Is this what I want to be? another gear in this pointless machine? 
A machine that makes the rich get richer, while everybody else seems to simply deal with what they have to do, with no real enjoyment or fulfillment save for the chance of having a nice retirement life.
What other choice do I have? Walk away? but to where? and how? I went to school for 15 years of my life. I got a degree. I followed every step that everybody else seemed to have taken, to end up in the same place as everybody else. All that to slave away for someone else's benefit. There isn't anything else I can do, is there? society gives us that illusion of freedomeople dressed in the same boring clothing that I'm wearing, all of it tinted in the slight glow of the sunset. 
I wonder how many times the tree has seen this same sight, how many people sat underneath it before me and if it has always been this way. Is it right? For this world to be filled only with a single color? 
I remember it used to be..  a little bit more colorful.
A leaf falls off from the tree, and I catch it within the palm of my hand. the leaf is red in color. for some reason, i feel the urge to keep the leaf, and tuck it into my pocket.
I can't really change this world in a big way, but i realize now that maybe i can do something, to bring a little bit more color into my life and the lives of others. 
By now the crowd has left. the sun has almost completely set, and the streetlights flicker on. i get up, and walk home under the luminous streetlight, thinking not about the work i have to do tmrw, but what i could do to bring a little change.
Maybe i'll try learning some of my coworkers names for once.
