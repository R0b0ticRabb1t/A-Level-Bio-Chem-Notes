## [[Child Language Acquisition|CLA]] Holophrastic Stage 1-2 years
Holo- whole +-phrastic way of speaking = whole word 
first word usually 12 months, --> 2 years - 200 words
ability to point out different people when asked

*attempting* **grammar** making one word sentences, that may be combined with actions for the caregiver to interpret

> [!example]
> - 'there'- pointing in a direction to mean: 
>   'i want to go there' or 'take me there'
> - 'up' - to mean 'pick me up', or show enthusiasm while riding an elevator

more consonant sounds, easy ones are:
- /m/ /n/ [[nasal sounds]]
- /b/ /p/ [[plosive sounds]]
key lexis learnt:
- 'important' nouns
- verbs, 
- environment conditions, 
- personal interactions

Later -> 2 worded sentences
not much tense or viewpoint
but order develops, and understanding of people

Its easy to notice at these stages how their language links with their wants and needs

Basic conversational Pattern
replying to questions
adjacent pairs
chattering to themselves and others,
