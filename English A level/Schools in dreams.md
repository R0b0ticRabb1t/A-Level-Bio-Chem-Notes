#### Schools in dreams
Last night i dreamt
I went to an old school 
i don't think it was an actual school, but more like a collection of every school i've went to before.

When the dream began, I found myself in an infinite corridor. not really infinite: past the first 4 doors, the walls of the corridor seemed to fade out into nothing, leaving behind a void. That same void was there behind me too.

I looked around the corridor, painted in all the colors i liked, hated and could remember. a meaningless pattern that still pleased me for no discernable reason.

after a moments hesitation- i opened the first door. 
Behind it was a classroom, simple and bland. an average classroom. there were no other students, but there was a single teacher, stuck in a pose, explaining something on the whiteboard. a small cupboard of shiny trophies sat in the back, and a large window showing a sunset on one wall
i could not make out a thing that was written on the whiteboard, and couldn't recall who the teacher was or what she taught me.
there wasn't much there, and i couldn't say i liked the room one bit, but i must admit to feeling a little nostalgiac somehow. i wished that room wasn't so.. lonely.
i sat in the room for a bit longer, staring at the walls. the walls had some blurry pictures on them, of people and events and things that felt a little familiar to me.

I walk out of that room now, and open the second door. Behind it, this time is a bedroom. No window this time.
There is a single bed, with a ladder to get on top of it, like a bunk bed exept the lower bed is replaced with a desk and cupboard.
Its all very plain, only coloured blue and white, however the desk is cluttered with all sorts of things. a couple books, textbooks, stationary, and a number of scattered papers. the cupboard is also probably filled, but i don't bother opening it.
there is another door connected to this room, but i cannot open it. the door is made of frosted glass, and i can still see through it a bit. there are people there, moving around, talking and laughing.
i wish i could join those people.

i do not stay for long, and walk back through the door i entered through.
back in the corridor that starts and ends with nothing.
there are only two doors that i haven't looked into yet.
these two however, are a little different.
they seem unfinished somehow
one is made of a flat piece of wood, not sanded yet. there is a hole where the doorknob would have been, and is half open.
the other is black, with little dots of various colors, placed in a seemingly random arrangement, made of an unreal material. i'm drawn to this one, but it has no knob, or even a hole where the knob would be, and its shut tight.
instead i walk through the rough wood door, and when i did that, i woke upNot good but thatâ€™s fine
